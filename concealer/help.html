        <h1>Questions about the Link Concealer</h1>
        <h3>Uh, what is this?</h3>
        <p>This is a online tool that allows you to conceal a given link to some extent. I made this as a fun project of mine.</p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>The generated link directs you to redirect.html, where all the calculations are performed.</p>
        <h3>Is this the most secure way to hide my link?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Absolutely not:</b> the processing is done locally and the code isn't even obfuscated.
            <small>I could, but I'm not in the mood.</small><br>
            If you want to truely hide your link, then look elsewhere. Use this just to hide links "at a glance".
        </p>
        <h3>Does this work with data URIs?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, and that's actually the reason I made this. For some reason I can't just redirect to data URIs, so I had to assemble a blob to make it work.<br>
            Also, at the moment embedding images doesn't work for some reason. Not sure why though.
        </p>
        <h3>When I regenerate my link, the generated link changed! Why?</h3>
        <p>It's just a quirk in my code.</p>
        <h3>Is this free?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Just don't use it for malicious purposes, okay? You're the one responsible for the generated links, not me.</p>
        <h3>Because of your website, my PC got a virus! I blame you!</h3>
        <p>Oof, tough luck. Also, no I'm not the one who held responsible for things like that.</p>
